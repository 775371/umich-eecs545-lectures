# EECS 545, Winter 2016

This repository contains the lecture materials for EECS 545, a graduate course in Machine Learning, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

## Lecture Readings

We will make references to the following textbooks throughout the course.  The only required textbook is Bishop, *PRML*, but the others are very well-written and offer unique perspectives.

No required reading.

#### Lecture 02:  Linear Algebra & Optimization
*Monday, January 11, 2016* 

- There are lots of places to look online for linear algebra help!
- Juan Klopper has a [nice online review](http://www.juanklopper.com/opencourseware/mathematics-2/ipython-lecture-notes/), based on Jupyter notebooks.
